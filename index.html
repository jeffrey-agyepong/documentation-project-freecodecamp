        <h1>What is Vue?</h1>

        <p>Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other
          monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is
          focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing
          projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications
          when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

          If you’d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a video walking through the core principles
          and a sample project.

          If you are an experienced frontend developer and want to know how Vue compares to other libraries/frameworks,
          check out the Comparison with Other Frameworks.</p>
        <p>Why is Vue.js important for Web Development?</p>

        <p>The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new
          to
          frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp
          the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the Hello World example. Feel free to open it in another tab and
          follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
    &lt;!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2/dist/vue.js"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
        <p class="center">or:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  &lt;!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"&gt;&lt; script&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
        <p>The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue. Note: We do not recommend that beginners start
          with "vue-cli", especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

          If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out this tutorial series on Scrimba, which gives
          you
          a mix of screencast and code playground that you can pause and play around with anytime.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declarative_Rendering">
      <header class="center">Declarative Rendering</header>
      <article>
        <p>At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM using
          straightforward
          template syntax:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;div&gt; id="app"
            
            &lt;/div&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code>
            var      new
                '#app'
            
              
                   'Hello Vue!'
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template, but
          Vue has done a lot of work under the hood. The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is now
          reactive.
          How do we know? Open your browser’s JavaScript console (right now, on this page) and set "app.message" to a
          different value. You should see the rendered example above update accordingly.</p>
        <p>
          Note that we no longer have to interact with the HTML directly. A Vue app attaches itself to a single DOM
          element (#app in our case) then fully controls it. The HTML is our entry point, but everything else happens
          within the newly created Vue instance.

          In addition to text interpolation, we can also bind element attributes like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
           
            &lt;div id="app-2"&gt;
            &lt;span v-bind:title="message"&gt;
                Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds
                to see my dynamically bound title!
                &lt;span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>

      <article>
        <p>Here we are encountering something new. The "v-bind" attribute you are seeing is called a directive.
          Directives are prefixed with "v-" to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may
          have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying “keep
          this element’s "title" attribute up-to-date with the "message" property on the Vue instance.”

          If you open up your JavaScript console again and enter "app2.message = 'some new message'", you’ll once again
          see that the bound HTML - in this case the "title" attribute - has been updated.</p>
        <p>A traditional disadvantage of single-page applications (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact
          "sub" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the
          server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue), bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific
          sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit
          their dynamic URLs with a "hashbang" (#!), e.g. page.com/#!/. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support
          routing without hashbangs.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Handling_User_Input">
      <header class="center">Handling User Input</header>
      <article>
        <p>Vue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path – regardless
          of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end
          router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks)
          occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn’t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source
          "vue-router" package provides an API to update the application's URL, supports the back button (navigating
          history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters.</p>
        <p> It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue,
          developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With
          vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to, and parent/root
          routes must indicate where children should render.</p>
